# OVERVIEW 

'Codex' is a project that is aimed towards creating a fun scripting language that performs basic computations and instructions.

# THEME

Codex - a manuscript book especially of Scripture, classics, or ancient annals.

The syntax is inspired from medieval speech and thus the name of the language "Codex". 

The purpose of the project has been to create a fun programming language whilst being appropriate and readable syntactically such that the code makes sense to other readers/programmers and performs what it is told.
